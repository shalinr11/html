    <h3>BASKET BALL</h3>

    <p>In the early years the number of players on a team varied according to the number in the class and the size of the playing area. In 1894 teams began to play with five on a side when the playing area was less than <a href="">1,800 square feet</a> (167.2 square meters); the number rose to seven when the <a href="">gymnasium</a> measured from 1,800 to 3,600 square feet (334.5 square meters) and up to nine when the playing area exceeded that. In <a href="">1895</a> the number was occasionally set at five by mutual consent; the <a href="">rules</a> stipulated five players two years later, and this number has remained ever since.</p>

    <p>Originally, players wore one of three styles of uniforms: knee-length <a href="">football</a> trousers; jersey tights, as commonly worn by wrestlers; or short padded pants, forerunners of today’s uniforms, plus knee guards. The courts often were of irregular shape with occasional obstructions such as pillars, stairways, or offices that interfered with play. In 1903 it was ruled that all boundary lines must be straight. In <a href="">1893</a> the Narragansett Machinery Co. of <a href="">Providence</a>, <a href="">Rhode Island</a>, marketed a hoop of iron with a hammock style of basket. Originally a ladder, then a pole, and finally a chain fastened to the bottom of the net was used to retrieve a ball after a goal had been scored. Nets open at the bottom were adopted in 1912–13. In 1895–96 the points for making a basket (goal, or field goal) were reduced from three to two, and the points for making a free throw (shot uncontested from a line in front of the basket after a foul had been committed) were reduced from three to one.</p>

    <p>The first college to play the game was either Geneva College (Beaver Falls, <a href="">Pennsylvania</a>) or the University of Iowa. C.O. Bemis heard about the new sport at Springfield and tried it out with his students at Geneva in 1892. At Iowa, H.F. Kallenberg, who had attended Springfield in 1890, wrote <a href="">Naismith</a> for a copy of the rules and also presented the game to his students. At Springfield, Kallenberg met <a href="">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a>, who became athletic director at the new University of Chicago in 1892. The first college basketball game with five on a side was played between the <a href="">University of Chicago</a> and the <a href="">University of Iowa</a> in Iowa City on January 18, 1896. The University of Chicago won, 15–12, with neither team using a substitute. Kallenberg refereed that game—a common practice in that era—and some of the spectators took exception to some of his decisions.</p>
    
    <h3>CRICKET</h3>

    <p>Cricket is a <a href="">bat-and-ball game</a> that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) <a href="">pitch</a> with a <a href="">wicket</a> at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three <a href="">stumps</a>. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled <a href="">illegally</a>.</p>

    <p>The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by <a href="">dismissing</a> batters (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being <a href="">bowled</a>, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the <a href="">crease</a> in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been <a href="">dismissed</a>, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from <a href="">Twenty20</a> (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days. </p>

    <p>Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white <a href="">kit</a>, but in limited overs cricket, they wear <a href="">club</a> or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent <a href="">injury</a> caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of <a href="">compressed leather</a> with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p>
