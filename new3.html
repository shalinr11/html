        <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus <a href="">Malus</a>. The tree originated in Central <a href="">Asia</a>, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many <a href="">cultures</a>, including Norse, Greek, and <a href="">European Christian tradition</a>.</p>

        <li><h3>STRAWBERRY</h3></li>

        <p>The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria in the <a href="">rose family</a>, Rosaceae, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, <a href="">pies</a>, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as confectionery, soap, lip gloss, <a href="">perfume</a>, and many others.</p>

        <li><h3>KIWI</h3></li>

        <p>Kiwifruit (often shortened to kiwi outside New Zealand and Australia) or <a href="">Chinese gooseberry</a>, is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.[1][2] The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit (<a href="">Actinidia</a> deliciosa 'Hayward')[3] is oval, about the size of a large <a href="">hen's egg</a>: 5–8 centimetres (2–3 inches) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1+3⁄4–2+1⁄4 in) in diameter. Kiwifruit has a thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart but edible light brown skin and light green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft texture with a sweet and unique flavour.</p>

        <li><h3>CHERRY</h3></li>

        <p>A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit).Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several <a href="">species</a>, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to <a href="">almonds</a> and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry blossom." Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although <a href="">Prunus avium</a> is often referred to specifically by the name "<a href="">wild cherry</a>" in the British Isles</p>

        <li><h3>BANANA</h3></li>

        <p>A banana is an <a href="">elongated</a>, edible fruit – botanically a berry[1] – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, cooking bananas are called <a href="">plantains</a>, distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a peel, which may have a variety of colors when ripe. It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (<a href="">parthenocarp</a>) cultivated bananas come from two wild species – Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana, or hybrids of them.</p>
