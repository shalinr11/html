    <h2 id="flower">FLOWER</h2>
    <p id="para1">A flower, also known as a <a href="">bloom or blossom</a>, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants
        (plants of
        the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs â€“ sepals that enclose and
        protect the developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce
        gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which produce sperm, are
        enclosed within pollen grains produced in the anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules
        produced in the ovary.

    <h2 id="waterfall">WATERFALLS</h2>
    <p id="para2">A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of
        steep drops.
        Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.Waterfalls can be
        formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of
        resistant bedrock before falling onto softer rock, which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall.
        Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.</p>
